  <summary>How to build the YouTube Plus app</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on <strong>Sync fork</strong>, and if your branch is out-of-date, click on <strong>Update branch</strong>.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Actions tab</strong> in your forked repository and select <strong>Create YouTube Plus app</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Run workflow</strong> button located on the right side.</li>
    <li>Mark or unmark the tweaks you want to integrate. Learn more about them in the <a href="#tweak-integration-details">Tweak Integration Details</a> section.</li>
    <li>Prepare a decrypted .ipa file <em>(we cannot provide this due to legal reasons)</em>, then upload it to a file provider (e.g., filebin.net, filemail.com, or Dropbox is recommended). Paste the URL of the decrypted IPA file in the provided field.</li>
    <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to provide a direct download link to the file, not a link to a webpage. Otherwise, the process will fail.</li>
    <li>Enter the tweak version from the releases (the latest release is selected by default). You can also change the BundleID and Display Name if desired.</li>
    <li>Make sure all inputs are correct, then click <strong>Run workflow</strong> to start the process.</li>
    <li>Wait for the build to finish. You can download the YouTube Plus app from the releases section of your forked repo. (If you can't find the releases section, go to your forked repo and add /releases to the URL, i.e., github.com/user/YTLite/releases.)</li>
  </ol>
